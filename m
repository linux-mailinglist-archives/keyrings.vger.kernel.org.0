Subject: [PATCH] watch_queue: Drop references to /dev/watch_queue
Date:   Mon, 19 Oct 2020 12:57:09 -0400
Message-Id: <20201019165709.5164-1-krisman@collabora.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.28.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <keyrings.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: keyrings@vger.kernel.org

The merged API doesn't use a watch_queue device, but instead relies on
pipes, so let the documentation reflect that.
